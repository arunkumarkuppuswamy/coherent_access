Coherent access provides a simple way to create shared editing and viewing
of nodes between users. The node types controlled via coherent access can be
controlled via the admin settings. Users also receive email notification when
they are given edit and view rights over nodes, and the content of these emails
is fully configurable.

Default behavior access control is;

only authors can edit
all users can view
only the author may delete
The author can modify the settings as follows;

They may add additional editors which will be given edit capabilities as well
as view capabilities They may add viewers. As soon as one user is added to the
view list only those listed in the view and edit lists as well as the author
may view the node.

The author cannot change the delete privileges For author-only editing and
viewing it is expected the author will un-publish a node
These access settings are available at node creation time.
